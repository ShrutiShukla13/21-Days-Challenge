# 21-Days-Challenge
This project evaluates the "21 Days Challenge," based on James Clear's "Atomic Habits," to determine its effectiveness in forming positive habits. By analyzing data from participants who made consistent changes over 21 days, we aim to understand how small, repeated actions can lead to lasting behavioral improvements.
